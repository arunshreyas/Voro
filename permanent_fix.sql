-- PERMANENT FIX FOR AVATAR UPLOADS
-- Run this to fix the RLS issue permanently

-- Step 1: Disable RLS temporarily
ALTER TABLE profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 2: Create profiles for all existing users
INSERT INTO profiles (id, username, full_name, avatar_url, bio)
SELECT 
  au.id,
  COALESCE(au.raw_user_meta_data->>'username', split_part(au.email, '@', 1)) as username,
  COALESCE(au.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', '') as full_name,
  NULL as avatar_url,
  NULL as bio
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON au.id = p.id
WHERE p.id IS NULL
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Step 3: Create the avatars storage bucket if it doesn't exist
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'avatars',
  'avatars',
  true,
  5242880, -- 5MB limit
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif', 'image/webp']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Step 4: Create storage policies for avatars
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own avatars" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own avatars" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own avatars" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view avatars" ON storage.objects;

CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatars"
  ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatars"
  ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1])
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatars"
  ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view avatars"
  ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Step 5: Re-enable RLS with proper policies
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 6: Create comprehensive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read all profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own profile" ON profiles;

CREATE POLICY "Users can read all profiles"
  ON profiles
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile"
  ON profiles
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile"
  ON profiles
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile"
  ON profiles
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Step 7: Test the setup
SELECT 'Setup complete - Avatar uploads should now work!' as status;
